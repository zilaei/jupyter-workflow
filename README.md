# Planning Permission Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook is designed to help you in understanding planning permissions using the OpenAI API.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- git
- pip
- Visual Studio Code with plugin [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter) installed

## Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, you need to clone the repository containing the notebook. Use the following command to clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zilaei/jupyter-workflow.git planning-permission-notebook
cd planning-permission-notebook
```


### 2. Install Dependencies
It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the dependencies required by this project separate from your global Python environment.

Create and activate the virtual environment:
```sh
python -m venv planning-env
source planning-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `planning-env\Scripts\activate`
```

Use pip to install the required Python dependencies from the requirements.txt file:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Copy Your Document

Copy the document you want to process into the ./data folder within the cloned repository:

```sh
cp path/to/your/document.pdf ./data/
```

### 4 Set up environment variables
Create a file named .env in the root of the cloned repository for environment variables.
There is a file named `.env_example` that can be used as a template:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

PLANNING_PERMISSION_FILE_PATH=./data/planning_permission_document.pdf

LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO
```

#### 4.1 Set Up API Keys

You'll need an API key from OpenAI for this notebook. If you don’t have a key, you can create one by signing up at OpenAI.

Add your API key to `.env` by setting variable `"OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here"`. 

Replace your_api_key_here with your actual API key.

#### 4.2 Setup up logging level (optinal)

You can also set up logging level by adding setting variable `LOGGING_LEVEL=INFO` in `.env`.

Replace INFO with your desired logging level (e.g. DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).

#### 4.3 Set Up Document Path
Additionally, you need to specify the file path to your document in the `.env` file by setting variable `"PLANNING_PERMISSION_FILE_PATH=./data/your_document.pdf`.

Replace your_document.ext with your actual document name and extension.

### 5 Run the Notebook

#### 5.1 VS Code
Open and run the notebook in VS code. Information about how to use Jupyter in VS code can be found at [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

#### 5.2 Jupyter
Optionally you could run the notebook in Jupyter:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook interface in your web browser. Navigate to the planning_permission.ipynb file and open it. 

Select your previously created virtual environment `venv` under menu Kernel -> Change kernel. 

Wait for the Kernel to restart and press the button "Not Trusted" button -> Press "Trust" in the pop-up.

Run all cells by selecting Kernel -> Restart & Run All -> Press "Restart and Run All Cells" in the pop-up.

Wait for all the cells to be run (an asterisk '*' will be displayd for not compleated cells).

More information about how to setup and use Jupyter notebook can be found at [jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/).

### Troubleshooting

Make sure that:
- You have installed all the dependencies from the requirements.txt file.
- You have set up your `.env` file correctly with the OpenAI API key and the path to your document.
